- instaed of relying on rcS to launch cog/cage, replace the getty in inittab and remove getty tty1 completely -> and make it autorestart program if crashes or relaunch cage with a error screen program
- try using egl again instead of cage
- custom splash
- llm ai bot
- ad hoc network support for monitoring and teacher contrl



- make sure the css has the repaint like this

body {
    animation: repaint 0.01s;
}
@keyframes repaint {
    from { opacity: 1; }
    to   { opacity: 0.99; }
}
