- Instead of relying on rcS to launch cog/cage, replace the getty in inittab and remove getty tty1 completely -> and make it an autorestart program if it crashes or relaunch cage with an error screen program
- Try using egl again instead of cage
- custom splash
- Error Dictionary
- ad hoc network support for monitoring and teacher control


------------------------make sure that the below lines go to the readme------------
- make sure the CSS has the repaint like this

body {
    animation: repaint 0.01s;
}
@keyframes repaint {
    from { opacity: 1; }
    to   { opacity: 0.99; }
}
