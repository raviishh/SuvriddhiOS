        <h1>Energy and Force</h1>
        
        <h2>What is Energy?</h2>
        
        <p>Energy is the ability to do work. There are multiple forms of energy, such as potential, kinetic, chemical, heat, etc. For example, a wrecking ball which has potential energy initially, gains kinetic energy and is able to do a lot of work.</p>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Energy Conservation</strong> states that energy cannot be created or destroyed – it can only be transformed from one form to another.</p>
            
            <p>The General theory of Relativity modified this concept to include <strong>Mass-Energy conservation</strong> which states that Mass and Energy together is conserved in a system – however Mass can be converted into Energy under special circumstances.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Mechanical Energy</h2>
        
        <p>While there are many forms of energy like Heat, Sound, Electrical etc., we will work here with <strong>Mechanical Energy</strong>. Mechanical energy is the energy a body possesses by virtue of its motion or position. It is of 2 types – Kinetic (KE) and Potential (PE).</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p>In the presence of conservative forces (e.g. Non friction), the total mechanical energy of a body or system is conserved. That means the sum of the potential and kinetic energy is a constant – individually their value may change but the sum will always remain the same.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Potential Energy (PE)</h2>
        
        <p>One type of Potential energy that a body possess by virtue of its position with respect to other bodies is called <strong>Gravitational potential energy</strong>. It is directly proportional to the masses of the 2 bodies and inversely to the square of the distance between them.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Gravitational Potential Energy (near Earth's surface):</strong></p>
            <p>PE = m × g × h</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>m = mass of the body</li>
                <li>g = gravitational acceleration (≈ 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>)</li>
                <li>h = height from Earth's surface</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>The PE at the Earth's surface is taken to be 0. Please note that the PE is measured relative to a base where the PE is considered to be zero. This base can be chosen arbitrarily (as per one's wish). Thus potential energy can be negative too – for example the potential energy within Earth's surface is negative (if the Earth's surface is the base with PE = 0).</p>
        
        <h2>Kinetic Energy (KE)</h2>
        
        <p>The KE, i.e. the energy due to motion is measured as ½ × mass × (velocity)<sup>2</sup>. Here we use the magnitude of velocity and not its direction.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Kinetic Energy:</strong></p>
            <p>KE = ½ × m × v<sup>2</sup></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Both PE and KE are scalar quantities – they only have magnitude or value, no direction. Since KE is a scalar, sometimes people use speed & velocity interchangeably.</p>
        
        <p>Since the total mechanical energy is unchanged in the absence of non-conservative forces, any increase or decrease in PE has a corresponding decrease or increase in KE.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Ball Rolling Down a Hill</h3>
            <p>As the ball rolls down the top of a hill, the PE reduces (as height reduces) while the KE increases, which means the ball gains more speed/velocity. At the bottom of the hill (earth's surface, say), the PE is zero while the KE is at its maximum value.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Given:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ball's mass = 1 kg</li>
                <li>g = 10 m/s<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li>Height of hill = 100 m</li>
                <li>Assuming absence of non-conservative forces</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Find: Speed/velocity of the ball at the bottom of the hill</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>PE at top = m × g × h = 1 × 10 × 100 = 1000 kg·m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup> = 1000 Joules</p>
            <p>(kg·m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup> is called Joules, which is the SI unit of work, energy, etc.)</p>
            
            <p>PE at bottom of hill (taken as base) = 0</p>
            <p>Change (decrease) in PE = 1000 J which must be the change (increase) in KE</p>
            
            <p>Initial KE = 0 (since the ball was at rest at the top of the hill)</p>
            <p>Final KE = 0 + 1000 = 1000 J (since KE increased by 1000 J)</p>
            
            <p>Let final velocity = v. Then:</p>
            <p>½ × m × v<sup>2</sup> = 1000</p>
            <p>½ × 1 × v<sup>2</sup> = 1000</p>
            <p>v<sup>2</sup> = 2000</p>
            <p>v = √2000 = 44.7 m/s</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The ball's velocity at the bottom is approximately 44.7 m/s</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Force</h2>
        
        <p>Force is simply any push or pull. Forces, you could say are so much a part of physics, as letters are to English.</p>
        
        <p>It has been said that Newton's first law gives a definition of Force while the second law gives a measurement of Force.</p>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Newton's First Law</h3>
            <p>The first law defines force as something which changes the state of "rest" or "uniform motion" of a body. It states that a body will remain at rest or continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed, unless a resultant force acts on it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Newton's Second Law</h3>
            <p>The second law measures force as mass × acceleration.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and it takes place in the direction in which the force acts.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Newton's Third Law</h3>
            <p>Newton's third law of motion states that when a body exerts a force on another body, the second body exerts a force of the same magnitude on the first body, but in the opposite direction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Momentum</h2>
        
        <p>Momentum is defined as a product of a body's mass times its velocity:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Momentum:</strong></p>
            <p>p = m × v</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Deriving F = m × a</h2>
        
        <p>Suppose a body of mass m is travelling at a velocity of u. Suppose a constant external force F acts on the body for time t. This force will change the velocity of the body; let the new velocity be v.</p>
        
        <p>The change in momentum = m×v – m×u and this change happens in time t.</p>
        
        <p>Thus, the rate of change of momentum = (m×v – m×u)/t = m×(v – u)/t</p>
        
        <p>We know (v – u)/t is the change in velocity over time t which equals the acceleration (a) of the body.</p>
        
        <p>From Newton's law we know rate of change of momentum is proportional to the external force.</p>
        
        <p>Hence, F is proportional to m × a, i.e. F = k × m × a where k is a constant of proportionality.</p>
        
        <p>We select k such that a force of 1 Newton on a mass of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Using the above units, we get k = 1 and thus the equation can be simplified as:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Force Equation:</strong></p>
            <p>F = m × a</p>
            <p>a = F/m</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">The SI unit of Force is Newton, represented as N.</p>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 1: Aircraft Take-off (Textbook Question 39)</h3>
            <p>A small aircraft of mass 520 kg needs to take-off with 30 m/s velocity using 200 m of runway.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>1. Find the acceleration required</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial velocity (u) = 0</li>
                <li>Final velocity (v) = 30 m/s</li>
                <li>Distance (s) = 200 m</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>Using: v<sup>2</sup> = u<sup>2</sup> + 2as</p>
            <p>30<sup>2</sup> = 0<sup>2</sup> + 2 × a × 200</p>
            <p>900 = 400a</p>
            <p>a = 900/400 = 2.25 m/s<sup>2</sup></p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>2. How much resultant force is needed for the take-off?</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>Force needed = mass × acceleration</p>
            <p>F = 520 × 2.25 = 1170 N</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The aircraft needs 1170 N of force for take-off</span></p>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example 2: Force and Acceleration</h3>
            <p>A constant force of 10 N acting on a body of mass 2 kg will produce an acceleration of 5 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>

            <p>When a body of mass 5 kg travelling at 10 m/s is opposed by a force of 10 N acting constantly till it stops, the retardation (negative acceleration) is -2 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Note this is negative since the body's velocity is being reduced until it stops.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Calculation:</strong></p>
