        <h1>Kinematics</h1>
        
        <p>Kinematics is the study of moving objects. A body is at rest when its position does not change with respect to time. A body in motion will have its position change with respect to time.</p>
        
        <p>The state of rest or motion of a body is measured with respect to a <strong>frame of reference</strong> – thus for a person standing on the railway platform, a train passenger (A) is in motion while for a fellow passenger in the train, A is at rest.</p>
        
        <h2>Distance vs Displacement</h2>
        
        <p>When an object travels from Point X to Point Y, the total path covered is called the <strong>distance</strong>. The length of the path joining X to Y along a straight line is called <strong>displacement</strong>. If the starting and the ending point are the same, for example, we take a walk and come back to the starting point, distance is the total path covered and hence non-zero while displacement will be zero.</p>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Distance</strong> is a scalar quantity – it has only magnitude (total path covered) but no direction.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Displacement</strong>, on the other hand, is a vector and it has both magnitude and direction. Its direction is along the line joining the 2 points, from the starting point to ending point.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Speed vs Velocity</h2>
        
        <p>Associated with distance & displacement, we have 2 quantities which give a measure of the motion of a body. These are <strong>speed & velocity</strong>. Speed is a scalar and hence has only magnitude but no direction while velocity is a vector with both magnitude & direction.</p>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Average speed</strong> is total distance covered divided by the time taken to cover that distance.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Average velocity</strong> is total displacement divided by the time taken for that displacement.</p>
            
            <p class="note">In both cases, the time remains the same – the total time taken. Please note that time is considered to be a scalar.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Speed thus is given by the quotient of 2 scalar quantities – distance & time – hence it is a scalar too. Velocity is given by the quotient of a vector (displacement) in the numerator and a scalar (time) in the denominator. Thus, velocity is a vector. The direction of velocity is same as the direction of the displacement.</p>
        
        <h2>Acceleration</h2>
        
        <p>Acceleration is another quantity which is used to define the rate of change of velocity. It thus defines the rate at which velocity changes. Acceleration is a scalar quantity. <strong>Average acceleration</strong> is given by quotient of Change in Velocity over Change in time.</p>
        
        <h2>Equations of Motion</h2>
        
        <p>Kinematics gives us a set of equations which can be used to define the motion of a body. In this lesson we will focus on:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uniform acceleration</strong> which means that acceleration does not change (in magnitude or direction) during the motion and the equations specific to this scenario</li>
            <li><strong>Motion in a straight line</strong> (1D motion)</li>
        </ul>
