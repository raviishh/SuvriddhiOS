        <h1>Friction, Circular Motion & Momentum</h1>
        
        <h2>Friction</h2>
        
        <p>Friction is one of the most important forces and it aids us in performing several routine tasks. While friction is largely viewed as a problem due to its effects, activities like walking, driving a car, braking etc. all can be executed due to friction.</p>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Friction is a self-adjusting opposing force</strong> – both words self-adjusting and opposing have significance.</p>
            
            <p>Value of friction (or frictional force) can change depending on the requirement till it reaches a maximum value. Thus it can have a value between 0 and f<sub>max</sub> (max frictional force).</p>
            
            <p>The direction of friction is always opposite to the applied force – thus if we push a book placed on a table to the right, friction will act towards the left. Thus, it always acts opposite to the intended direction of motion.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Friction is very useful in our daily lives, it enables our cars to move, or even for us to walk. Friction is due to the irregularities in the surface, even a smooth surface is quite rough on zooming in.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Friction</h2>
        
        <p>Friction can be of 2 types – <strong>static and kinetic</strong>. Static friction is applicable when a body is at rest while kinetic friction applies when a body is in motion.</p>
        
        <p>One of the parameters determining friction is the <strong>coefficient of friction</strong> represented by the Greek letter μ (mu). μ<sub>s</sub> and μ<sub>k</sub> represent the coefficient of static & kinetic friction.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Friction Force:</strong></p>
            <p>f = μ × N</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>μ = coefficient of friction</li>
                <li>N = normal force on the body</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">It always acts opposite to the direction of intended motion.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>When we walk or drive a car, our foot or the tyre tends to push backwards and thus that becomes the intended direction of motion. Hence the friction force acts in the forward direction and helps in the motion.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Block on a Table</h3>
            <p>Consider block A lying on top of a table. Let us apply a force F on block A to move it to the right. Let there be friction between the block and the table and the coefficient of this friction is μ.</p>
            
            <p>The mass of the block is "m" and hence its weight is mg. Let N be the normal force exerted by the table on the block. Let "f" be the frictional force acting at the contact surface between block & table.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Consider the block is at rest. Hence all the forces in the various directions should balance:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vertically:</strong> N = mg</li>
                <li><strong>Horizontally:</strong> F = f</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Friction is proportional to the coefficient of friction between the 2 surfaces and the normal force. Thus, f is given by μ × N. Note that this is the maximum frictional force – friction will adjust its value as per the applied force F so that it can oppose the motion of the block (to the right).</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Example with numbers:</strong></p>
            <p>For m = 1 kg and μ = 0.5. The maximum friction f<sub>max</sub> = 1 × 10 × 0.5 (consider g = 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>) = 5 Newton</p>
            
            <p>If the applied force F is at 3 Newton, then friction f will be at 3 Newton. Till F reaches 5 Newton, friction will just equal the value of F and no more.</p>
            
            <p>Once F > 5 Newton, then friction will be maximum at 5 Newton and the block will move to the right due to the net force of (F – f<sub>max</sub>).</p>
            
            <p class="note">Note: once the block starts to move, the coefficient of static friction is replaced by coefficient of kinetic friction, which is usually lower; during motion the frictional force on the block will be slightly lower than 5 Newton.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Question from Textbook (15a)</h3>
            <p>A 54 kg wooden block is sliding on a horizontal concrete floor (coefficient of static friction = 0.3), find the minimum horizontal force required to start it moving sideways.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>The normal force is equal to mg = 54 × 9.81 = 529.74 N of force.</p>
            <p>Hence the maximum friction force is:</p>
            <p>f<sub>max</sub> = μ × N = 0.3 × 529.74 = 158.922 N</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The block must be pulled with minimum 158.922 N to make it start moving.</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Circular Motion</h2>
        
        <p>So far we have looked at motion in a straight line which is referred to as translatory motion. Such motions are governed by the 3 laws of kinematics for linear motion.</p>
        
        <p>Another class of motion considers movement of bodies in non-linear paths – a special case being <strong>motion in a circular path</strong>. Here the body moves in a circle round a point (centre). Let us consider the simplistic case of uniform circular motion, where the angular velocity of the body does not change.</p>
        
        <h2>New Terms for Circular Motion</h2>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Angular distance:</strong> It is the angle through which the body rotates in a given time. It is represented by θ and expressed in radians or revolutions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Angular velocity:</strong> It represents the speed of rotation. At the simplistic level, it is given by (Angular distance / time). It is represented by ω (omega) and is expressed in radians/sec or revolutions/min.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Angular acceleration:</strong> This represents the rate of change of the angular velocity. It is represented by α (alpha) and the units are radians/sec<sup>2</sup>. It is to be noted that for the uniform circular motion, angular acceleration will be 0 since the angular velocity does not change.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Relationship Between Linear and Angular Quantities</h2>
        
        <p>The corresponding linear quantities like distance, velocity and acceleration are related to the above quantities by the factor of "radius" (r).</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
                <li>Linear distance = Angular distance × r</li>
                <li>Linear velocity = Angular velocity × r</li>
                <li>Linear acceleration = Angular acceleration × r</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Centripetal Acceleration and Force</h2>
        
        <p>When a body goes in a circular path with uniform speed (i.e. angular velocity), the linear velocity is constantly changing in direction (not in magnitude). At any point the linear velocity is tangential to the circular path at that point.</p>
        
        <p>Using vector addition (subtraction), on the linear velocity at 2 very close points, we can find the net acceleration for uniform circular motion.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Centripetal Acceleration:</strong></p>
            <p>a = v<sup>2</sup>/r</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>v = linear velocity</li>
                <li>r = radius of the circular path</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Centripetal Force:</strong></p>
            <p>F = ma = mv<sup>2</sup>/r</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The direction of this acceleration (instantaneous) will be radially inwards – pointing towards the centre. This acceleration is called <strong>centripetal acceleration</strong> and the corresponding force (ma = mv<sup>2</sup>/r) is called <strong>centripetal force</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>The centripetal force is what keeps the body moving in the circular path. In the absence of this force, the body will fly off in a tangential direction. Hence this force has to be provided to keep the body in the circular path. In case of heavenly bodies which rotate in a circular or near circular path, the centripetal force is provided by the gravitational force of attraction between the 2 bodies.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Mass Rotating in a Circle</h3>
            <p>Assume a mass of 2 kg, rotating in a circle of radius 1 m. How fast must it be rotating such that the tension in the string at the top is 0?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>At the top, for tension to be 0, the centripetal force must equal the weight:</p>
            <p>2g = (2 × v<sup>2</sup>)/1</p>
            <p>v<sup>2</sup> = g</p>
            <p>v = √g = √10 = 3.13 m/s</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The mass must be rotating at approximately 3.13 m/s</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Momentum</h2>
        
        <p>Momentum comes from the Latin word movimentum, which means 'to move'. Momentum can be understood as a measure of the amount of "motion" a body possesses. Higher the momentum of a body, greater is the force needed to stop its motion.</p>
        
        <p>Consider a small rock and a big boulder, each moving with the same velocity. It seems logical that we will need more force to stop the big boulder as opposed to the small rock, even though both are moving at the same velocity. Similarly, a big boulder at rest (zero velocity) needs no force to stop it even though it is huge, while a small rock which is moving with a certain velocity definitely needs some force to stop it.</p>
        
        <p>From the above two statements, it seems apparent that momentum seems to depend at least on velocity and mass of bodies.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Momentum:</strong></p>
            <p>p = m × v</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>p = momentum (or linear momentum)</li>
                <li>m = mass of the body</li>
                <li>v = velocity</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Given mass is a scalar and velocity is a vector, momentum is a vector and its direction is same as the direction of the velocity of the body.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Newton's second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force – thus if the force on a moving body is higher, the rate of its momentum change will be higher too. Hence, as an example, the magnitude of the force (in the direction of the momentum/velocity) determines how quickly the moving body can be brought to rest.</p>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Bringing a Body to Rest</h3>
            <p>A body of mass 2 kg travelling at a velocity of 10 m/sec has a momentum of 20 kg·m/sec.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Case 1: Stop in 2 seconds</strong></p>
            <p>To bring this body to rest in 2 seconds, we will need a force F of 20/2 = 10 N resisting the body for 2 seconds.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Case 2: Stop in 5 seconds</strong></p>
            <p>If the same body is to be brought to rest in 5 seconds, the required force F will be 4 N (acting for 5 seconds).</p>
            
            <p class="note">Thus, the lesser the time to change a body's momentum from an initial value to a final value, higher is the force required.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Conservation of Momentum</h2>
        
        <p>The momentum of a system of bodies is the vector sum of all its momentum – vector sum because momentum has direction and is a vector.</p>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Conservation of Momentum</h3>
            <p>Since force is the quantity that causes a change in momentum, it follows that in the absence of an external force on a system, the total momentum of the system is always the same; in other words, linear momentum of a system is conserved in the absence of an external force. The effect of the internal forces all cancels out.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">The principle of conservation of momentum is one of the fundamental principles in physics and it is used extensively in solving many problems related to collisions, separations etc.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Impulse</h2>
        
        <p>The change of momentum of a body is called its <strong>impulse</strong>. Since force is rate of change of momentum:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p>F = Δp / Δt</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Where Δ indicates the change in the quantity; Δp is the change in momentum and Δt is the change in time.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Impulse:</strong></p>
            <p>Δp = F × Δt</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Thus F is the average force over the time interval needed to bring about the required change in momentum.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Cricket Ball</h3>
            <p>A cricket ball of mass 0.15 kg is coming towards the batsman at a velocity of 144 km/hr. The batsman sends the ball back in exactly the opposite direction at a velocity of 144 km/hr. The bat remains in contact with the ball for 0.1 sec. What is the average force applied by the bat on the ball?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>Consider final direction of travel of the ball as positive. Then the initial direction of travel is negative.</p>
            
            <p>144 km/hr = 40 m/sec</p>
            
            <p>Initial momentum p<sub>i</sub> = -0.15 × 40 = -6 kg·m/sec</p>
            <p>Final momentum p<sub>f</sub> = 0.15 × 40 = 6 kg·m/sec</p>
            
            <p>Change in momentum = p<sub>f</sub> – p<sub>i</sub> = 6 – (-6) = 12 kg·m/sec</p>
            
            <p>Thus Impulse (J) = 12 kg·m/sec in the direction of the final momentum</p>
            
            <p>This impulse is generated over a time period of 0.1 second</p>
            
            <p>The average force F is given by:</p>
            <p>F × Δt = J</p>
            <p>F = J / Δt = 12 / 0.1 = 120 Newtons</p>
            
            <p><span class="highlight">The average force applied by the bat is 120 N</span></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p>For bodies which undergo rotational motion, we have a similar concept of Angular or Rotational momentum. However, this is the topic of another lecture.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Vector Components</h2>
        
        <p>For projectile motion or other cases involving multi-dimensional vectors we often split our initial force, velocity, or impulse into horizontal and vertical components. It is a fact that perpendicular vectors do not affect each other, which is why we split our force/velocity/impulse into horizontal and vertical components.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Vector Components:</strong></p>
            <p>If the velocity vector, magnitude V, makes an angle of θ with the horizontal (x axis), then:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin-top: 10px;">
                <li><strong>Horizontal velocity:</strong> V<sub>x</sub> = V cos(θ)</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical velocity:</strong> V<sub>y</sub> = V sin(θ)</li>
            </ul>
