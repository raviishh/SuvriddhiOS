        <h1>Optics</h1>
        
        <p>Optics deals with light, its travel or propagation, reflection, refraction, dispersion and other advanced concepts. Some of the key concepts are essential to understanding several of the day-to-day phenomena.</p>
        
        <h2>Rectilinear Propagation of Light</h2>
        
        <p>The foremost concept is about the <strong>rectilinear propagation of light</strong> i.e. light travels in straight lines in most cases. There are exceptions, but we will exclude those at this stage. The principle of light travelling in straight lines is responsible for causing shadows.</p>
        
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        
        <p>When light rays meet a surface, they reflect partly or wholly from that surface – in other words the light rays bounce off and travel back in the same medium (the material through which light was initially travelling). This is called <strong>reflection</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Laws of Reflection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane</li>
                <li>The angle of incidence (angle between the incident ray and the normal at the point of incidence) equals the angle of reflection (angle between the reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Regular reflection:</strong> When a set of parallel incident rays after reflection at a surface remain parallel.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Diffuse reflection:</strong> When the reflected rays travel in various directions and are not parallel.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Mirrors</h2>
        
        <p>Mirrors can be plane mirrors or curved mirrors (convex, concave etc.). The equation between the object distance, image distance & radius of curvature of the mirror surface is given by:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Mirror Equation:</strong></p>
            <p>1/v + 1/u = 2/R</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">or</p>
            <p>1/v + 1/u = 1/f</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 0.9em;">
                <li>v = image distance</li>
                <li>u = object distance</li>
                <li>R = radius of curvature</li>
                <li>f = focal length = R/2</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Sign Convention for Mirrors</h2>
        
        <p>All distances are measured from the <strong>pole</strong> of the mirror (the point at the middle of the mirror). The line joining the pole to the centre of curvature is called the <strong>principal axis</strong> of the mirror.</p>
        
        <p>Direction of the incident ray is taken as positive. Usually in the ray diagrams, the object is placed to the left of the reflecting surface of the mirrors as a convention. Thus the direction of the incident ray is along the positive X axis.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object distance</strong> is taken as negative since it is measured along the negative X direction</li>
                <li>For a <strong>convex mirror</strong>, the centre of curvature lies on the other side of the mirror and is taken as positive (R > 0, f > 0)</li>
                <li>For a <strong>concave mirror</strong>, the centre of curvature is negative (R < 0, f < 0)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>P</strong> denotes the pole which is the midpoint of the mirror</li>
                <li><strong>C</strong> is the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror</li>
                <li>The length <strong>CP</strong> is the radius of curvature</li>
                <li><strong>F</strong> denotes the focus and <strong>FP</strong> is the focal length which for mirrors is half the radius of curvature</li>
                <li>The line joining P & C is called the <strong>Principal Axis</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Focus and Image Formation</h2>
        
        <p>When a parallel beam of light rays is incident on the spherical mirror, after reflection they converge or appear to diverge from a point on the principal axis called the <strong>focus</strong>. For mirrors the focal distance (distance from pole to focus) is ½ the radius of curvature.</p>
        
        <p>If the rays converge after reflection at the mirror, we get a <strong>real image</strong>; if they diverge we get a <strong>virtual image</strong> after tracing the rays backwards.</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Magnification (Lateral):</strong></p>
            <p>Image Height / Object Height = - (Image Distance / Object Distance)</p>
            <p>h<sub>i</sub> / h<sub>o</sub> = - (v / u)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> For a real image after reflection (rays converge), the image is formed on the same side as the object. Hence both object and image distances are negative. Thus, Image height comes out to be negative (object height is taken as positive). This implies the image is formed upside-down. <strong>All real images formed due to reflection are upside down or inverted compared to the object.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Refraction</h2>
        
        <p>Refraction is the bending of light when it travels from one transparent (which allows light to travel in it) medium to another. Light travels with different speeds in different medium and this causes the rays to change direction thus bending the ray.</p>
        
        <p>Every medium through which light travels has a property called <strong>refractive index</strong> denoted by the Greek letter μ (mu). This determines the extent of bend of a light ray as it goes from one medium to another. μ essentially is a ratio of speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in that medium.</p>
        
        <div class="note">
            <p>Note that since the frequency of light does not change as it traverses multiple medium (as frequency only depends on the source of the wave), both velocity and wavelength change as light travels from one medium to another.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="law-box">
            <h3>Laws of Refraction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The incident ray, refracted ray and the normal at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane</li>
                <li>The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction for a pair of medium (1 & 2) is a constant and is equal to the ratio of their refractive indices (RI of medium 2 to RI of medium 1)</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Note:</strong> 1 is the medium where light is incident and 2 is the medium into which it gets refracted</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Snell's Law:</strong></p>
            <p>sin(i) / sin(r) = n<sub>2</sub> / n<sub>1</sub></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9em;">Where:</p>

        <h2>Lenses</h2>
        
        <p>In case of refraction through lenses (which are used in many optical instruments, cameras etc.) the equation for the image tracing is given by:</p>
        
        <div class="equation">
            <p><strong>Lens Equation:</strong></p>

        <h2>Double Slit Experiment</h2>
        
        <p>In 1801, an English scientist, Thomas Young performed what was known as the <strong>double slit experiment</strong>, where Thomas Young shot a monochromatic laser through 2 identical slits. On a distant screen, an interference pattern was seen, proving that light is a wave due to the diffraction at the slits.</p>
        
        <p>Let us look deeper into this pattern. In the interference pattern we see multiple bright and dark fringes. When the wave goes through the slit, it produces a second source.</p>
        
        <div class="definition">
            <p><strong>Bright fringe:</strong> Formed when the path difference between the 2 light waves is a multiple of the wavelength</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dark fringe:</strong> Formed when the path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>We have that the path difference is equal to yd/D where:</p>
        <ul>

        <div class="note">

            <p>Using: n × λ = yd/D, we can rearrange to: d = n × λ × D / y</p>
